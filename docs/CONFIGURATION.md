Runtime configuration, the admin account, content filtering, file uploads, and backup for a HahaSNS deployment. For first-time install and run instructions see [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md); for deployment see [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md).

> **架构**：后端为 **NestJS 10 + TypeORM 0.3 + MySQL/MariaDB（mysql2）+ Redis（缓存）+ 存储驱动（本地磁盘或 S3）**，源码位于 `server-nest/`。单个 Node 进程在 `PORT` 上同时伺服 SPA（`client/dist`，由 `CLIENT_DIST` 指定）、`/api` 接口与 `/uploads` 静态文件。完整变量见 `server-nest/.env.example` 与 [INSTALL-1panel.md](INSTALL-1panel.md)。

## Environment variables

HahaSNS reads configuration from process environment variables (copy `server-nest/.env.example` to `.env`). Production deployments **must** set `JWT_SECRET` and the database credentials.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `JWT_SECRET` | `change-me-to-a-long-random-string` | Secret used to sign and verify JWT auth tokens. **In production you MUST set a strong, random value** (e.g. a long random string from a password manager or `openssl rand`). Anyone who knows the secret can forge login tokens for any account, so treat it like a password and never commit it. Changing the secret invalidates all existing sessions. |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | `30d` | Token lifetime. |
| `SEED_ADMIN_USER` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | — | Optional first-run admin bootstrap. If **both** are set and the DB has no admin yet, an admin account is auto-created on startup (no manual SQL). Ignored once any admin exists. Change the password after first login; you can drop these vars afterwards. |
| `PORT` | `4000` | TCP port the Node process listens on (serves the SPA + `/api` + `/uploads`). |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | — | Unset = direct exposure (`req.ip` = socket IP). Behind a reverse proxy set `1` (trust first hop) or `loopback` so `req.ip` reads `X-Forwarded-For` — needed for per-IP registration rate-limiting to see the real client. |
| `DB_CLIENT` | `mysql` | Database driver. |
| `DB_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Database host. |
| `DB_PORT` | `3306` | Database port. |
| `DB_USER` | `hahasns` | Database user. |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | — | Database password. |
| `DB_NAME` | `hahasns` | Database name. |
| `DB_SYNCHRONIZE` | `false` | When `true`, TypeORM auto-creates/updates tables from the entities on startup — convenient for the **first run** of a fresh install. **Set it back to `false` afterwards** so schema isn't auto-altered in production. |
| `DB_LOGGING` | `false` | Log SQL queries. |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://127.0.0.1:6379` | Redis connection used for caching. |
| `REDIS_TTL` | `30000` | Default cache TTL in milliseconds. |
| `CLIENT_DIST` | `client/dist` (relative to the build) | Path to the built frontend (`client/dist`) served as the SPA. |
| `UPLOADS_DIR` | `uploads` (relative to the build) | Directory where uploaded media is stored (served at `/uploads`). |
| `STORAGE_DRIVER` | auto (`s3` if S3 keys present, else `local`) | Storage backend: `local` (write to `UPLOADS_DIR`) or `s3`. |
| `S3_ENDPOINT` / `S3_BUCKET` / `S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `S3_SECRET_KEY` / `S3_REGION` / `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` / `S3_PUBLIC_URL` | — | S3-compatible object storage settings, used when `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` (works with AWS S3, MinIO, rustfs, etc.). |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Optional. Enables the AI assistant; without it the assistant runs in a demo/placeholder mode. |

Set them via a real secrets mechanism — a `.env` file with restricted permissions, systemd `Environment=`, a container secret, etc. — rather than inlining values in scripts you commit.

## Admin account

A fresh install starts with no users and no built-in admin / default password. Two ways to get the first admin:

**A. Auto-bootstrap (no SQL).** Set `SEED_ADMIN_USER` and `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` before first start; if the DB has no admin yet, that account is created automatically on startup (idempotent — ignored once an admin exists). Log in and change the password, then you may remove the two vars.

**B. Promote manually.** Register an account through the normal sign-up flow, then set its role to `admin`:

```sql
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE username = '<your-username>';
```

After that, log in and use the admin panel for site operation and moderation. The public is expected to register their own accounts; admin accounts are only for operating the site.

> **Security:** choose a strong password for the admin account, since it has full control over the site. Because there is no shipped default credential, an instance is not "open" out of the box — but never give admin to an account whose password you wouldn't trust on a public service.

## Admin site settings（站点设置）

A number of site-wide settings are configurable at runtime from the admin panel — no code change or restart needed. They are persisted in the generic `site_config` key/value table, so **adding or changing a setting needs no DB migration**. Admins read/write them via `GET /api/admin/config` and `PUT /api/admin/config`; the public-facing values are exposed through `GET /api/site`.

| Setting | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| **模块（modules）** | Enable/disable site modules (features). |
| **外观（appearance）** | Site appearance (e.g. name, default skin). |
| **安全（security）** | Security toggles (e.g. content filter / moderation switches). |
| **布局（layout）** | Per-page layout, stored as `site_config` keys `layout_<page>` with values `default`（三栏）/ `wide`（宽屏）/ `narrow`（居中）. Covered pages include collections, nav, mall, circles, achievements, member, bookmarks, history, settings, changelog and thread. `GET /api/site` returns these as a `layouts` map; the frontend `useLayout(key, fallback)` reads them so layout can be switched from the admin「布局」tab without code changes. |

## Initial data (fresh install starts empty)

There are no seed scripts in this version — **a fresh install starts with an empty database.** On first run with `DB_SYNCHRONIZE=true`, TypeORM creates the schema (see [Database & backup](#database--backup) below); the tables are then empty.

To get going, register the first account through the normal sign-up flow and promote it to admin (see [Admin account](#admin-account)). All other content — boards, topics, mall products, etc. — is then created through the app and the admin panel.

## Sensitive-word content filter

User-generated text is screened by a lightweight content filter. It normalizes input (lowercasing and stripping spacing/punctuation between characters to resist evasion) and checks it against a sensitive-word list covering common moderation categories.

The filter is applied on content-creation endpoints (posts, comments, threads, messages, etc.): submissions that match are rejected with a validation error so the content is never stored.

The word list is **configurable at runtime** from the admin「安全」(security) panel — it is stored in the `site_config` table, so tuning moderation for your community needs no code change, redeploy, or restart. Note this is a demo-grade filter, not a substitute for full moderation tooling.

## File uploads

Image/file uploads are handled by the storage driver selected with `STORAGE_DRIVER`:

- **`local`** (default when no S3 keys are configured): files are written to the `UPLOADS_DIR` directory and served statically at the `/uploads` URL path.
- **`s3`**: files are uploaded to an S3-compatible bucket configured by the `S3_*` variables (AWS S3, MinIO, rustfs, etc.) and served from the bucket's public URL.

The database stores references (URLs) to these files, not the file contents themselves. With the `local` driver, treat `UPLOADS_DIR` as part of your data when backing up or migrating (see below); with `s3`, the bucket holds the media.

## Database & backup

HahaSNS stores its data in a **MySQL/MariaDB** database (configured by the `DB_*` variables). On the first run with `DB_SYNCHRONIZE=true`, TypeORM creates and updates the tables from the entity definitions — there is no separate migration step for a fresh install. Set `DB_SYNCHRONIZE=false` afterwards so the schema isn't auto-altered in production.

**What to back up**

- The **MySQL/MariaDB database** (all application data).
- The user-uploaded media — the `UPLOADS_DIR` directory when using the `local` storage driver, or the S3 bucket when using `s3`.

**How to back up safely**

Dump the database with `mysqldump`, then back up the media separately. For example:

```bash
# database dump
mysqldump -u "$DB_USER" -p "$DB_NAME" > hahasns-backup.sql

# local uploads (local storage driver)
tar -czf hahasns-uploads.tar.gz -C "$UPLOADS_DIR" .
```

Restore by importing the SQL dump into a database of the same name (`mysql -u "$DB_USER" -p "$DB_NAME" < hahasns-backup.sql`) and putting the media back in `UPLOADS_DIR` (or restoring the S3 bucket). The database holds only URL references to media, so the two must be kept in sync.
